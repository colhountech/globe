# globe
globe spinning

few dependecies

* `sudo apt install sensors` - for CPU Temperature. Some day I might fix this
* OpenWeather API. Requires an API Key. Also have to set City
* Volcano data comes from xxxx, and this needs to be parsed
* TimeZone not set
* Home is set to 'Belfast' needs to get location to give accurate Home Location

Don't commit until API Key for weather is extracted to secrets, and
City and Home is set to secrets too.
